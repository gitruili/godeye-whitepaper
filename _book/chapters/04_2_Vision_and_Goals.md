# 2. Vision and Goals

Godeye's vision is to become the Google of the Web3 era, providing global users with real, comprehensive, and in-depth data services. By building a "vote to earn" prediction market, we hope to achieve the following goals:

**1. Reshape Data Value:** Break the traditional data-monopoly pattern, enabling users to transform from data consumers to creators and sharers of data value. Users can participate in prediction voting with their knowledge, experience, and insights, converting them into actual value and realizing the re-distribution of data value.

**2. Promote Intelligent Decision-Making: **Relying on our self-developed big-data prediction model and investment decision-making assistant AI Agent, we provide investors with accurate and reliable decision-making bases. Through in-depth analysis and intelligent prediction of massive data, we reduce investment risks, improve decision-making efficiency, and help investors make informed decisions in a complex and changeable market environment.

**3. Build a Decentralized Ecosystem:** Build a decentralized prediction market based on Web3 technology. Use blockchain technology to achieve decentralized data storage and management. Ensure that market rules are transparent and enforced fairly through smart contracts, eliminating human intervention and fraud. Guarantee the immutability and traceability of data, enhance users' trust in the platform, and build an open, fair, and sustainable ecological environment.

**4. Innovate the Incentive Mechanism:** Introduce an integral system. Users can obtain points by participating in prediction voting, and these points can be exchanged for rewards such as airdrops. This further stimulates users' enthusiasm for participation, enhances user stickiness, and promotes the prosperous development of the platform ecosystem.
