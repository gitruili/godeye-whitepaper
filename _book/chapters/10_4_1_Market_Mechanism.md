# 4.1 Market Mechanism

In Godeye's "vote to earn" prediction market, when users participate in voting, they submit their prediction choices based on their own analysis and judgment. After voting, they can obtain points. Each vote earns 10 points, and each user can vote up to 10 times a day. These points can be used to obtain token airdrops.

In the future, the voting weight will be determined by multiple factors, including the number of platform tokens held by users, historical prediction accuracy, and participation activity. The more tokens a user holds, the higher the voting weight. Users with high historical prediction accuracy will also receive a higher weight bonus in subsequent votes. Users who actively participate in platform activities and vote frequently can also obtain a certain weight increase. This comprehensive weight-calculation method encourages users to improve their prediction abilities, hold platform tokens, and actively participate in the construction of the platform ecosystem.

After a prediction event has a final result, the platform conducts reward distribution and integral calculation based on users' prediction accuracy and voting weights. Users who predict correctly will not only receive token rewards but also obtain corresponding points according to their voting weights. Users who predict incorrectly will not receive rewards but can still accumulate a certain number of basic points to encourage their participation.

At the same time, we will gradually support prediction-for-profit functions in multiple fields such as finance, sports, politics, and technology.
