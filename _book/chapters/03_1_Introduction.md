# 1. Introduction

In the current booming digital economy, data has become a core production factor and the most valuable asset. However, traditional prediction markets and data service platforms have many drawbacks. The centralized operation model leads to data being controlled by a few institutions. The authenticity and fairness of data are difficult to guarantee, and users, as passive data consumers, have not fully realized their participation value. Web3 technology, with its characteristics of decentralization and transparency, and AI technology, with its powerful data-analysis capabilities, bring new opportunities for the development of the industry. Godeye takes advantage of this trend, deeply integrating Web3 and AI technologies to create a "vote to earn" prediction market, building a fair, transparent, and value-sharing ecosystem. We aspire to become a leader in the data-service field in the Web3 era, just as Google's outstanding position in the Internet era, providing high-quality data services to global users.
