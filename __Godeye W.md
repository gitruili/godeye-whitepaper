**Godeye Whitepaper**

AI-Driven Cryptocurrency Prediction Data Platform and Autonomous Hedge Fund

Become the data infrastructure for all AI Agents

**Abstract**

At the crossroads of blockchain technology and the AI boom, Godeye, with the mission of "Foreseeing the Future", builds the first full-stack AI investment ecosystem in the Web3 domain. We serve as a value hub connecting human intelligence and machine decision-making — through an AI-native predictive intelligence network and an autonomous hedge fund matrix, we provide global token holders, trading AI Agents, and institutional investors with an "intelligent telescope" to penetrate market uncertainties, enabling every capital to find optimal solutions in data intelligence.

**1. Vision and Goals**

Godeye is committed to creating a decentralized intelligent capital alliance:

- For retail investors: Break the institutional data monopoly. Through AI-generated visual investment intelligence, transform professional-level strategic analysis into easy-to-understand decision tools and lower the threshold for crypto investment.
- For AI Agents: Build an open strategic execution infrastructure, supporting custom algorithm access and cross-chain asset allocation to achieve full-process automation from signal generation to transaction execution.
- For the industry ecosystem: Through token economic incentives, aggregate global AI developers, data providers, and investors to form a smart investment closed loop of "prediction - decision - execution - feedback", driving the evolution of Web3 finance toward algorithm-driven, transparent, trustworthy, and risk-controllable models.

**2. Core Products (Partial Basic Functions Implemented)**

AI-Native Investment Infrastructure Matrix

**2.1 Market Sentiment Prediction Module**

- Data Dimensions: Real-time crawling of on-chain data sources, mainstream media/communities (Twitter, Telegram, Discord), and CeFi/DeFi market data to build a 24-hour dynamic sentiment map.
- Technical Breakthrough: An NLP model based on the Transformer architecture, combined with a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), achieves minute-level market sentiment prediction and improves the accuracy of sentiment forecasting.
- Product Form: Visual sentiment indices, early-warning signals for emergencies, supporting API interfaces and terminal subscriptions.

**2.2 Cryptocurrency Prediction Model**

- Multimodal Modeling: Integrates over 100 feature dimensions, including prices, on-chain activity, developer behavior (GitHub code commit volume), and macroeconomic indicators (USD index, CPI), providing easy-to-use visual prediction models.
- Dynamic Tuning Mechanism: Enables automatic strategy iteration to adapt to bull-bear cycle switches.
- Strategy Output: Provides multi-strategy portfolios such as trend tracking, arbitrage hedging, and DeFi yield enhancement, supporting custom risk parameters.

**2.3 AI Agent**

The AI Agent is a smart decision-making assistant created by Godeye for investors. Based on technologies such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) and large models, the AI Agent can deeply understand investors' personalized needs, including investment goals (e.g., asset appreciation, risk aversion, long-term investment), risk preferences (conservative, stable, aggressive), and investment experience. Through natural language interaction with investors, it collects investment intentions and questions, integrates knowledge systems such as market knowledge, industry information, and investment strategies, and is committed to providing more excellent visual investment intelligence than AiXBT.

**3. Token Economy**

**3.1 Token Uses**

Godeye's platform token carries the following core values:

- Service Access Rights: Stake tokens to unlock advanced strategies, API call quotas, etc.
- Ecological Governance Rights: Participate in on-chain governance proposals such as strategy voting and transaction fee adjustments.
- Value Capture Layer: 50% of the ecological transaction fees and strategy subscription fees are used for repurchase and burning, achieving positive binding between token value and ecological growth.
- Identity Marker: Holding tokens makes you a member of the Godeye DAO, with priority access to IDOs of ecological projects, airdrops of ecological projects, early testing of AI Agents, profit sharing of hedge funds, and other privileged activities.

**3.2 Token Issuance, Repurchase, and Burning**

After the token goes live, we will promote its listing on centralized exchanges to ensure good liquidity and market value. Meanwhile, the platform will establish a sound token circulation management mechanism, regulating token supply and demand through measures such as repurchase and burning to maintain stable token prices. Additionally, we will incentivize users to hold tokens long-term through activities such as token staking and locking to enhance market stability.

**Issuance:** The token adopts a fixed total supply model with an initial issuance of 1 billion tokens. The team portion (50%) is used for team incentives, project development, and operational support.

**Repurchase:** 50% of platform revenue is used to repurchase and burn tokens.

**Burning:**

When the market capitalization reaches $10 million, burn 100 million tokens or 20% of the team's tokens.

When the market capitalization reaches $100 million, burn 100 million tokens or 20% of the team's tokens.

When the market capitalization reaches $1 billion, burn 100 million tokens or 20% of the team's tokens.

` `4. Team and Partners

` `**4.1 Core Team**

Godeye's core team consists of AI Agent experts, blockchain engineers, data scientists, and hedge fund researchers:

AI Agent experts are responsible for algorithm design and optimization of AI Agents.

Blockchain engineers focus on Web3 technical architecture development and smart contract development to ensure the platform's decentralization and security.

Data scientists are responsible for data processing, analysis, and mining to provide high-quality data for model training.

Hedge fund researchers focus on developing low-risk, high-return autonomous hedging strategies.

With rich experience and outstanding technical capabilities, the team members provide a solid guarantee for the successful implementation and sustainable development of the project.

**4.2 Partners**

Godeye has currently established good partnerships with **AIxVC**, **Buzzing**, **AskTian**, and **Virtuals**, striving to provide high-quality predictive data for **Virtuals ACP** **members**. In the future, we will establish strategic partnerships with more well-known enterprises and institutions to jointly create a prosperous kingdom of AI Agents.

**5. Roadmap**

**Phase 1 – Foundation (Completed)**

- Basic functions of sentiment prediction, including user voting and analysis charts of voting results.
- AI Agent, supporting text, chart, and web interaction to provide users with high-quality investment information.
- Cryptocurrency prediction model to provide users with high-quality trading signals.

**Phase 2 – Q3 2025**

- Integrate on-chain data (e.g., transaction activity, wallet flows) and off-chain public opinion (social media, news) to develop more visual predictive data.
- Support buying and selling trend predictions for mainstream currencies such as ETH and SOL.
- Launch risk warning functions for BTC, ETH, and SOL, etc.
- Launch the first hedge fund.
- Enable token holders to access advanced predictive data.

**Phase 3 – Q4 2025**
