- **Service Access Rights:** Stake tokens to unlock advanced strategies, API call quotas, etc.

- **Ecological Governance Rights:** Participate in on-chain governance proposals such as strategy voting and transaction fee adjustments.

- **Value Capture Layer:** 50% of the ecological transaction fees and strategy subscription fees are used for repurchase and burning, achieving positive binding between token value and ecological growth.
