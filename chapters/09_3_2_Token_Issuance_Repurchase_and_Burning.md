# 3.2 Token Issuance, Repurchase, and Burning
After the token goes live, we will promote its listing on centralized exchanges to ensure good liquidity and market value. Meanwhile, the platform will establish a sound token circulation management mechanism, regulating token supply and demand through measures such as repurchase and burning to maintain stable token prices. Additionally, we will incentivize users to hold tokens long-term through activities such as token staking and locking to enhance market stability.
