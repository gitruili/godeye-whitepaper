# 1. Vision and Goals

Godeye is committed to creating a decentralized intelligent capital alliance:

- **For retail investors:** Break the institutional data monopoly. Through AI-generated visual investment intelligence, transform professional-level strategic analysis into easy-to-understand decision tools and lower the threshold for crypto investment.

- **For AI Agents:** Build an open strategic execution infrastructure, supporting custom algorithm access and cross-chain asset allocation to achieve full-process automation from signal generation to transaction execution.

- **For the industry ecosystem:** Through token economic incentives, aggregate global AI developers, data providers, and investors to form a smart investment closed loop of "prediction - decision - execution - feedback", driving the evolution of Web3 finance toward algorithm-driven, transparent, trustworthy, and risk-controllable models.
