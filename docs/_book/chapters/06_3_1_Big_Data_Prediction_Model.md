# 3.1 Big-Data Prediction Model

Godeye's self-developed big-data prediction model is the core technical pillar of the platform. This model integrates advanced machine-learning and deep-learning algorithms and can efficiently process massive structured and unstructured data. In the data-processing process, technologies such as data cleaning and feature engineering are used to pre-process the original data and extract key features, providing high-quality data for model training.

The model learns from historical data, identifies patterns within it, and is dynamically updated in combination with real-time data, thus achieving accurate predictions of the development trends and results of various events. Taking financial-market prediction as an example, the model comprehensively analyzes multi-dimensional data such as macro-economic data (e.g., GDP growth rate, inflation rate, interest rate, etc.), industry dynamics (industry policies, competition patterns, technological innovations, etc.), and social-media sentiment (investor sentiment, market hot-topic discussions, etc.). It uses algorithms such as time-series analysis and causal inference for reliable predictions, providing valuable reference information for investors.

The model architecture is highly flexible and extensible. It adopts a modular design, which can quickly adjust model parameters and structures according to different prediction scenarios and requirements, achieving customized predictions. At the same time, a continuous model-training and optimization mechanism is established. By regularly collecting new data, optimizing algorithms, the prediction accuracy and reliability are continuously improved. In addition, with the help of distributed computing technology, data-processing and model-training tasks are distributed to multiple computing nodes, improving the efficiency of processing large-scale data and meeting the real-time requirements of the platform.
