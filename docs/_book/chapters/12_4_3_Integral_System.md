# 4.3 Integral System

The platform introduces an integral system as one of the important incentive methods for users to participate in predictions. Integral not only reflects users' participation and contribution levels but also has a wide range of uses. Users can obtain points through the following multiple methods:

**1. Participation in Voting: **Each time a user participates in a prediction vote, regardless of the prediction result, they can obtain 10 points.

**2. Correct Prediction: **In addition to token rewards, users who predict correctly will receive additional bonus points according to their voting weights. The higher the weight, the more bonus points they will get.

**3. Inviting Friends: **When a user invites a friend to participate in platform voting, the inviter can receive a 500 points reward.

**4. Sharing: **Sharing on social platforms such as X and Telegram can earn 50 points per share.

Points can be used to exchange for various rewards. The most attractive one is to exchange for airdrops. The platform regularly launches airdrop activities, and users can use a certain number of points to exchange for token airdrops of the platform or other cooperative projects. In addition, points can also be used to exchange for the platform's value-added services, such as advanced data-analysis reports, exclusive investment-strategy suggestions. Through the integral system, users' enthusiasm for participation is further stimulated, user stickiness is enhanced, and the activity and development of the platform ecosystem are promoted.
