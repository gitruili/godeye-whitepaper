# 3.3 Web3 Technology Architecture

Godeye builds its underlying architecture based on Web3 technology, with blockchain technology at the core to achieve decentralized data storage and management. Distributed ledger technology is used to store key data such as users' prediction-voting records, income-distribution information, and integral data on the blockchain, ensuring data immutability and traceability. Smart contracts are used to write and execute the rules and logic of the prediction market, including aspects such as prediction-event creation, voting processes, income distribution, and integral calculation, ensuring that rules are transparent and enforced fairly, and eliminating human intervention and fraud.

The platform uses decentralized identity verification (DID) technology to create a unique digital-identity identifier for users. Users have autonomous control over the usage rights of their personal data. Only with authorization can the platform obtain necessary user information, such as basic identity information and transaction records, effectively protecting user privacy and data security. Based on the Web3 token-economy system, a complete incentive mechanism is constructed to encourage users to actively participate in predictions, contribute data, and promote the platform. At the same time, the issuance, distribution, circulation, and management of tokens are realized through smart contracts to ensure the stable operation of the token-economy system. In addition, the platform also supports interconnection and interoperability with other Web3 applications and ecosystems, achieving data sharing and business collaboration and expanding the ecological boundaries of the platform.
